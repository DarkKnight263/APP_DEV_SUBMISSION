# APP_DEV_SUBMISSION
my submission for GDSC MPSTME app dev 

this project is a campus app for students of mpstme(new building).

upon opening the app it goes through the standard login process using the sap ids provided to all the student
then the app offers various menus to the user

1.Canteen

one can check the daily menu with prices ,then proceed to check availaibility of seats at the canteen. This will help students maximise their break time as they would not have to physically come to the canteen to look at the things provided above,they can simply check the app and make the required decision.

2.Library

one can check the lists of books they have issued along with applicable due dates and fines,one can also browse through the libraray data base and raise a ticket to issue a book. the ticket will be available to the librarian on a partner app, they will then take the necessary steps required and mail back the student within a time limit.seat availability feature is also available too.

3.Labs

students might want to conduct their own experiments for research or practice their lab work. this feature enables students to raise a ticket to book the chosen lab,they have to also specify the required apparatus,materials and their agenda for the booking. lab assistant will get back to student via email with details like cost,timings available etc

4.Reserve a classroom

students might want to reserve a classroom to discuss and work on projects, carry out small seminars for fellow students etc. This works similar to lab booking, students have to specify purpose,capacity,materials required(mic,speakers etc) etc the concerned department will revert to the student via mail with the necessary details.

5.Faculty

displays a table with details of faculty like name,department,contact details,where they sit etc.

6.Locate

helps in locating places within the campus,super helpful for new students.All they need to do is select destination and the shortest path would be displayed over the map of the building.

7.Events

displays details about upcoming events at the campus.

8.Report

used to report issues which might require urgent action. This also works on a ticket system. situations marked urgent just have a quicker response time

Urgent:

1.Discipline:

2.Technical:

smart board,ac,lights not working? get immediate help by raising a ticket with tech department.Students are required to specify location of issue

3.Cleaning:
